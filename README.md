# Compare_classification_randomForest_and_decisionTree
this is to compare decision tree and random forest with accuracy score . in datasets, i'm using iris dataset for classification and stroke dataset to define who that get stroke based on the datasets.

happy hacking !!!

score accuracy Decision Tree = 0.97777777
score accuracy Random Forest = 0.97777777

Example tree decision using gini impurity model:
